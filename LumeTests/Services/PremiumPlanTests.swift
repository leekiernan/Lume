//  Guards the plan catalogue against the mistake that shipped once already: the
//  "monthly" plan was advertised as an auto-renewing subscription while the product
//  behind it — `com.bilipp.lume.premium.monthly` — was a non-consumable in App Store
//  Connect. Non-consumables never appear under App Store ▸ Subscriptions, so buyers
//  had no way to cancel something the paywall told them renewed every month.
//
//  These are contract tests, not behaviour tests: they pin the product IDs and the
//  renewable/purchasable split so a future edit can't quietly put the retired product
//  back on sale or mark a one-time unlock as renewable.
