//
//  BrowseQueryShapeTests.swift
//  LumeTests
//
//  The browse fetches have performance contracts that no visible row depends on:
//  a `fetchLimit` that bounds a rail, a probe with no `sortBy`, a playlist scope
//  that runs in SQLite instead of in Swift, and a lexical comparator that is the
//  only reason an index can serve the "Recently Added" sort.
//
//  Each of those is one token. Remove it and the app still shows exactly the
//  right rows — just after scanning the whole table — so the change survives
//  review, the rest of this suite, and every screenshot. On the measured 284k-row
//  catalog those same tokens were worth 1,904 -> 774 ms on launch and
//  1,158 -> 145 ms on a single favorite tap.
//
//  `LumePerformanceTests/BrowseQueryBenchmarks.swift` measures what they cost.
//  These tests just assert they are still there, in the normal suite, on every
//  commit — which is the half that runs in CI.
