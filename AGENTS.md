# Lume — AI Agent Guide

Lume is a native, multi-platform IPTV player (iOS 18+, macOS 15+, tvOS 18+, visionOS 2+) built with SwiftUI + SwiftData. Single Swift codebase with four interchangeable playback engines: KSPlayer (default) → VLCKit → AVPlayer, plus the opt-in beta LumeEngine (sibling repo `../LumeEngine`). It is built with the iOS 26 SDK and uses Liquid Glass / iOS 26 navigation APIs where available, falling back to system materials on older OS versions.

---

## Build & run

```bash
# Open in Xcode
open Lume.xcodeproj   # pick scheme "Lume", any destination

# CLI build (iOS Simulator)
xcodebuild build \
  -project Lume.xcodeproj -scheme Lume \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro' \
  -clonedSourcePackagesDirPath ~/Library/Developer/Lume-SharedSPM
```

The project injects API secrets from a repo-root `.env` file via `Scripts/inject-env.sh`. The file is gitignored; features degrade gracefully when it's absent.

### Private DerivedData needs a shared package clone

Parallel builds (per platform, per worker, per worktree) each need their own
`-derivedDataPath /tmp/lume-dd-<label>` — the project has several DerivedData
dirs and a bare `xcodebuild` can install a stale app. **Always pair that with
`-clonedSourcePackagesDirPath ~/Library/Developer/Lume-SharedSPM`.** Without it
each private DerivedData re-clones the whole package graph — KSPlayer's FFmpeg
xcframeworks plus VLCKit's 865 MB xcframework, **6.4 GB per build dir**; eight
of them once filled `/tmp` with 65 GB. Sharing one clone dir also builds faster
and dodges the botched-checkout race that breaks multi-platform archiving.

Delete your `-derivedDataPath` dir when the task is done, or run
`Scripts/clean-build-cache.sh` (report only; `--apply` to reclaim, `--deep` to
also drop DeviceSupport, the SwiftPM download cache and idle simulators). It
deliberately keeps the two live package checkouts and each checkout's
`.build/tools`, which is what the pre-commit hook runs SwiftFormat/SwiftLint
from.

## Testing

Tests deploy to **iOS 26.4+ Simulator only** — never tvOS. Use an iPhone 17 Pro or newer sim; iOS 26.2 sims fail with a deployment-target mismatch (exit 65).

```bash
# Every invocation below takes the shared package clone — see "Private
# DerivedData needs a shared package clone" above.
SPM=(-clonedSourcePackagesDirPath ~/Library/Developer/Lume-SharedSPM)

# Full suite
xcodebuild test -project Lume.xcodeproj -scheme Lume "${SPM[@]}" \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro'

# Unit tests only
xcodebuild test -project Lume.xcodeproj -scheme Lume "${SPM[@]}" \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro' \
  -only-testing:LumeTests

# UI tests only
xcodebuild test -project Lume.xcodeproj -scheme Lume "${SPM[@]}" \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro' \
  -only-testing:LumeUITests
```

Every test `ModelConfiguration` must set `cloudKitDatabase: .none` — `@Attribute(.unique)` models + the default `.automatic` crashes on entitled simulator hosts.

## Performance testing

Benchmarks live in their own target (`LumePerformanceTests`), scheme
(`LumePerformance`), test plan (`Performance.xctestplan`) and build configuration
(**Benchmark** = Release + `ENABLE_TESTABILITY`). They are *not* in the `Lume`
scheme, so a normal `xcodebuild test` never runs them.

```bash
Scripts/run-performance-tests.sh                    # whole suite + measurements
Scripts/run-performance-tests.sh ParsingBenchmarks  # one suite
```

- Never benchmark in Debug — `-Onone` makes parser/import numbers fiction. That's
  what the Benchmark configuration exists for.
- Store benchmarks use **on-disk** containers (`PerfStore`); in-memory skips
  SQLite, the very cost being measured.
- **`context.save()` is ~90% of the *Xtream* import.** That figure is from a
  282,288-row Xtream catalog of series shells; it does not describe the m3u cold
  path, where 86% of the entries are episodes. There the biggest single item was
  wiring `Episode.series` through the initializer instead of assigning it after
  `context.insert` — 64% of the whole import.
- **Four knobs were measured at under 6%** — `batchSize` (500/2k/10k/50k all
  within noise), the 11 `#Index` groups on `Movie`, `@Attribute(.unique)`, and
  the per-batch existing-row lookup. On a 178k-row harness that no longer
  exists; only the existing-row lookup has been re-verified at 1.5M rows. Don't
  re-derive them; `LumePerformanceTests/README.md` carries the numbers.
- **`M3UColdImportBenchmarks` is the end-to-end one** — it drives the real
  `ContentSyncManager.syncPlaylist` over a provider-shaped `file://` playlist,
  with clock, peak RSS and every m3u signpost in one pass.
- Fixtures are generated per run from a fixed seed (`PerfFixtures`), never
  committed.
- App-defined phases are named once in `Services/Diagnostics/PerformanceSignposts.swift`
  (`Perf.begin`/`Perf.end`). Those names are a contract with `SignpostBenchmarks`
  and feed Instruments' Points of Interest lane — rename one and update both.
- Field layer, in the shipping app: `AppPerformanceMetrics` (MetricKit; compiled
  out on tvOS) and `PlaybackQoE` (join time, rebuffer ratio, exits before video
  start, engine fallbacks). Both surface in the exported diagnostic report.
- `PlaybackQoE` flushes to `UserDefaults` at session boundaries only — never
  periodically, which is what used to hitch KSPlayer.

See `LumePerformanceTests/README.md` for baselines and why there is no CI gate.

Two separate `ModelContainer`s:
- **Catalog** (`default.store`) — local-only, what all `@Query` bindings target
- **CloudKit mirror** (`CloudUserData.store`) — user state (profiles, watch progress, favorites); never bind `@Query` against this container

## Key patterns & gotchas

### Swift concurrency
`SWIFT_DEFAULT_ACTOR_ISOLATION=MainActor` is set project-wide. Value types and DTOs used by `nonisolated` callers must be explicitly marked `nonisolated` (type + every extension).

### SwiftData
- Enrichment saves run on a **background** `ModelContext` (`ContentSyncManager.enrich*`) — not the view context.
- Main-thread saves during playback stall KSPlayer every ~5 s. Buffer to `UserDefaults`; flush at playback boundaries.
- `PlaylistDeletion` helper must be used for any playlist removal (UI **and** iCloud reconcile) — `Movie`/`Series`/`LiveStream` have no cascade relationship to `Playlist`.
- The reconciler after `switchProfile` rebuilds the dropped content shadow — don't remove that pass; optimize the fetch predicate instead.

### iCloud sync
- Guard reconcile against `LocalCatalogReadiness`; an empty `default.store` would push mass deletions to CloudKit.
- `UserProfile` must be deduped on every reconcile (not just launch) — fixed-id default profiles multiply per device in CloudKit.

### tvOS-specific
- `Color.accentColor` resolves to white on tvOS — never use it for fills/tints.
- `.onMoveCommand` runs inside the focus engine's animated context; defer layout mutations with `Task { }`.
- Full-width focus targets needed for vertical navigation — a narrow target won't catch "down" from a full-width section.
- `@FocusState` must not drive layout sizing in the hero fold — use `TVHomeScreen`'s `ScrollTargetBehavior`.

### KSPlayer
- Hardware decode requires **both** `asynchronousDecompression = true` **and** `hardwareDecode = true`; `async` defaults to `false` → silent software decode → frame drops on tvOS.
- Never call `layer.prepareToPlay()` on a running session — use `player.replace()` (`rebuildStream(on:)`) to avoid a UAF crash.
- Frozen image + healthy audio on live TV = MPEG-TS 2³³ clock wrap; fixed by the `noteClockDrift()` watchdog.

### LumeEngine (beta, 4th engine)
- Our own FFmpeg 9 engine, developed in the sibling repo [`bilipp/LumeEngine`](https://github.com/bilipp/LumeEngine) and referenced as a **local** SPM package at `../LumeEngine` — a clone without that sibling (and its FFmpeg xcframework built once) will not resolve. It has its own `AGENTS.md` and a `PLAN.md` that is authoritative for engine design.
- App-side wiring only lives here (`Lume/Views/Player/LumeEngine*.swift`); demux/decode/render/sync bugs are engine-side. Decide which side a bug belongs to *before* editing.
- Declared last in `PlayerEngineKind` so it appends to the end of existing priority lists — opt-in, never silently promoted while KSPlayer is the default.
- The engine never retries on its own schedule: reconnect/backoff, engine fallback, and overlays stay Lume's job. If a fix would add retry policy to the engine, it belongs here instead.

### Localization
String Catalogs (9 languages: en, de, es, fr, it, ja, ko, pt, zh-Hans; the App Store listing mirrors them — see `ship-release`'s `references/store-metadata.json`). Run `xcstringstool sync` and include the tvOS stringsdata. Normalize `.xcstrings` with `Scripts/normalize-xcstrings.swift` (pre-commit hook) to avoid format churn.

### Pre-commit hooks (lefthook)
SwiftFormat + SwiftLint run as errors. Notable: `String(decoding:)` is banned; `redundantStaticSelf` crashes on `for x in (try? …) ?? []` — avoid that pattern.
