//
//  StoreRelocation.swift
//  Lume
//
//  Moves the SwiftData stores out of the app-group container, once.
//
//  The legacy app group (originally added for Live Activity artwork)
//  made `ModelConfiguration.groupContainer` — `.automatic` by default — resolve
//  both stores into the shared container. iOS terminates a suspended process
//  that still holds a file lock there (RUNNINGBOARD 0xdead10cc), and a catalog
//  or guide save running as the app is backgrounded holds exactly that SQLite
//  lock. Nothing but the app process opens either store, so they belong in the
//  app's own container, where a suspension
//  mid-write is harmless.
//  Keep the app-group entitlement until older installs have migrated their stores.
