/// re-derivable from the provider, and uses `@Attribute(.unique)` which CloudKit
/// forbids. Instead this lightweight record carries only what a fresh device
/// needs to reconstruct a playlist; once it lands, the existing auto-sync path
/// fetches that playlist's catalog locally.
///
/// `id` matches the local `Playlist.id` verbatim. Because every catalog id
/// embeds the owning playlist's UUID (`"<playlistUUID>-movie-<streamId>"` etc.),
/// preserving the UUID across devices is what lets per-content user state
/// (`UserContentState`) reconcile by id without any cross-device lookup table.
///
/// CloudKit constraints honoured here: every stored property is optional or has
/// a default, there is no `@Attribute(.unique)`, and there are no relationships.
/// Credentials use `.allowsCloudEncryption` so they ride the private database
/// end-to-end encrypted rather than as plaintext record fields.
