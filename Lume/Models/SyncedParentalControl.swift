/// CloudKit-synced mirror of the parental-control PIN.
///
/// The PIN itself is never stored — only the salted SHA-256 hash that
/// `ParentalControlsStore` keeps in the keychain. The keychain remains the local
/// store of record (it is what `verify` reads); this record exists purely as the
/// *transport* between devices, because iCloud Keychain does not sync to tvOS —
/// and tvOS is precisely where an unenforced parental gate matters most.
///
/// Deliberately **not** profile-scoped, unlike `UserContentState`: the PIN is the
/// thing a child uses to escape their profile, so scoping it to a profile would
/// make it unenforceable exactly when it is needed.
///
/// A singleton in practice — `id` is always `Self.singletonID`. CloudKit cannot
/// enforce uniqueness, so two devices can each insert one before they converge;
/// the reconciler dedupes on `updatedAt`.
///
/// ## Security note
///
/// CloudKit's private database is encrypted in transit and at rest but is not
/// end-to-end encrypted the way iCloud Keychain is. That is a real downgrade in
/// protection for this hash — though a modest one in practice: a four-digit PIN
/// drawn from 10,000 candidates, salted with a constant that ships in the binary,
/// falls to brute force the moment anyone holds the hash, wherever it is stored.
/// The PIN is a parental speed bump, not a secret, and is treated as one here.
///
/// CloudKit constraints honoured: every stored property is optional or defaulted,
/// there is no `@Attribute(.unique)`, and there are no relationships.

/// Like `SyncedParentalPIN` and unlike `UserContentState`, this is **not**
/// profile-scoped. A restriction is a rule a parent sets *about* a child profile,
/// not a preference belonging to whichever profile happened to be active when it
/// was set. Riding the per-profile channel would file it under the parent's
/// profile and then never re-apply it while the child's profile was active —
/// which is the bug this record exists to prevent.
///
/// Only categories a parent restricted get a record, so a playlist nobody
/// locked anything in costs nothing. Lifting a restriction keeps the record,
/// with `isRestricted` false, so another device can tell a lift from a record
/// it hasn't imported yet (`IntentMerge`); lifted records expire after
/// `IntentMerge.clearedRecordLifetime`.

/// `categoryID` matches `Category.id` verbatim, which embeds the playlist UUID,
/// so a record written on one device addresses the same category on every other
/// device once that playlist's catalog has synced.
