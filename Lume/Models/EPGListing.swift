    // XMLTV guide for thousands of channels runs to hundreds of thousands of
    // rows). Every now/next lookup and the guide window query filter by
    // `channelId` and the `start`/`end` time bounds, so index them — without
    // these, each channel card and guide open scans the whole guide table.
    // The in-player lookups (now/next, the channel's upcoming list, the guide
    // window) all bound on `end > now` rather than on `start`, so the
    // `channelId + start` pair above can only seek to the channel and then walk
    // every listing it ever had. `channelId + end` is the pair those predicates
    // actually ask for — `TVPlayerContent.guideListings` has claimed this index
    // in a comment since it was written, without it ever existing.
