    // Home's trending/watchlist rows look titles up by `tmdbId`. The home
    // screen's `@Query`s (Recently Watched / Favorites) and the iCloud
    // reconciler also filter the catalog by user-state columns. Index every
    // column those predicates touch so a foreground CloudKit merge seeks the
    // handful of favorited / in-progress rows instead of scanning the whole
    // catalog on the main thread — the unindexed scan is what froze the app on
    // tvOS when returning from background.
    // `categoryId` is the primary filter for every category browse/preview and
    // `genre` for the browse-by-genre derivation; index both so opening a
    // category or switching playlists seeks instead of scanning the whole
    // catalog on a large library.
    // `indexedAt` backs the content indexer's pending/progress scans (run once
    // per chunk for a whole indexing pass) and `downloadStatusRaw` the Downloads
    // screen's live `@Query`, which re-evaluates during catalog syncs.
    // `added` is the sort key for the "Recently Added" rail, which asks for a
    // handful of rows off the top of a descending sort. Unindexed that plans as
    // "SCAN ZMOVIE + USE TEMP B-TREE FOR ORDER BY" — the whole table sorted to
    // hand back 20 rows, 222 ms per run on a 179k-title catalog. The index only
    // pays off while the ordering stays a binary comparison: a `SortDescriptor`
    // on a String key path defaults to `.localizedStandard`, which emits
    // `COLLATE NSCollateFinderlike` and no b-tree can serve that.
