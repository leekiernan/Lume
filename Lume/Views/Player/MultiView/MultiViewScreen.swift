//
//  Multi-View: two to four live streams playing at once, one of them carrying
//  the audio. Useful for sports, and the only way to watch two channels from
//  providers that allow a single concurrent connection per playlist — hence the
//  picker being free to reach across playlists (#43).
//
//  Deliberately not `FullScreenPlayerView` repeated N times: that host owns
//  watch-progress writing, Next Up, skip-intro, AirPlay routing and the audio
//  session, all of which are single-stream concerns. A tile is video plus mute
//  (see `MultiViewTilePlayer`).
