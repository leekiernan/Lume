//
//  MacPlayerWindowRouter.swift
//  Lume
//
//  Keeps macOS to ONE player window.
//
//  `WindowGroup(id: "player", for: PlayableMedia.self)` keys a window on the
//  value it was opened with, so once the viewer steps to the next episode or
//  the next channel from inside the player, the open window no longer matches
//  the item the library shows as playing. Opening that item again would spawn
//  a second window — a second engine, a second audio session and a second Now
//  Playing publisher contending for the shared `MPRemoteCommandCenter`. So
//  every play request re-opens on the window's *launch* value, which focuses
//  the window that already exists, and hands the stream it actually wants to
//  the running player through `pendingMedia`.
