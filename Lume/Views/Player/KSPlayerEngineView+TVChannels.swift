//  KSPlayerEngineView+TVChannels.swift
//  Lume
//
//  In-player live channel switching for the KSPlayer host on tvOS: Siri-remote
//  channel surfing (up/down/right with the controls hidden) and the two-column
//  channel browser raised by a left press. Split out from the view file to keep
//  it under the SwiftLint file-length threshold; the state these members drive
//  is `internal` (not `private`) so this same-module extension can reach it.
