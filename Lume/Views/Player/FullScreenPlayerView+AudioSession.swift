//  The player's global audio-session handling, split out of
//  `FullScreenPlayerView` to keep that file inside the 600-line cap.
//
//  Only LumeEngine needs this: KSPlayer and VLCKit configure `AVAudioSession`
//  themselves, so these two calls are no-ops from their point of view but must
//  still bracket every session, since the engine in use can change mid-player
//  through a fallback.
