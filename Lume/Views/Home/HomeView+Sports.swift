//  Lume
//
//  Home's side of the Sports Hub: whether the Sports rail has anything to render
//  (the empty-state check shares `SportsRailPlanner` with the rail itself) and
//  the warm that keeps it fed.
//
//  The warm lives on Home rather than inside `SportsHomeRail` on purpose. The
//  rail renders nothing at all while a followed league has no fixtures — which
//  is exactly the state that needs a fetch — so its own `onAppear` never fires
//  there and the row stayed empty for the whole session unless the viewer found
//  Settings › Sports › Refresh Now. Home is always on screen; the warm is keyed
//  so it re-runs when the entitlement or the followed set finally lands.
//
