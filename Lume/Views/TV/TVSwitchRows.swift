//  The playlist and profile rows shared by every tvOS switch surface (the
//  Settings Playlists/Profiles panes and the quick-switch overlay). They draw the
//  row itself only — the Settings panes compose their pencil affordance alongside
//  one, so a surface that must not offer editing simply leaves it out.
