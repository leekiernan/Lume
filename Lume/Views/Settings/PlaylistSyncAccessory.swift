//  Lume
//
//  The small trailing indicator a playlist row draws when its sync needs
//  attention — and draws nothing at all when it doesn't. Shared by the iOS /
//  macOS settings list and the tvOS playlist row so the two can't drift.

import SwiftUI

/// Trailing accessory for a playlist row: a spinner while syncing, a glyph for
/// the states worth surfacing, and nothing for a playlist that is fine.
///
/// The empty case is the important one. A row that badges every state teaches
/// the eye to skip the badge, so the healthy majority stays silent and the
/// accessory only ever means "look at this one".

    /// so the caller sets this rather than the view guessing from the platform.
