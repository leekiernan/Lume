//  Resolves other entries of the *same* title (matched by TMDB id) for the
//  "Other Sources" row: alternate streams within the same playlist (e.g. a
//  different quality or language) followed by copies on the user's other
//  playlists, the latter labelled with the owning playlist's name so the UI can
//  badge them. Shared by the movie and series detail screens (iOS, macOS and
//  tvOS) so the row behaves identically everywhere.
