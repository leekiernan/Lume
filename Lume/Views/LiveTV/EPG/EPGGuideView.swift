//
//  EPGGuideView.swift
//  Lume
//
//  A classic "TV guide" grid for a category: a frozen channel column on the
//  left, a frozen time ruler across the top, and programme blocks sized to
//  their duration. A live "now" line tracks the current moment.
//
//  Data (channels + listings) is queried and shaped into rows once, in this
//  parent. Scroll offset lives in the child scroller, so panning the grid never
//  re-runs the row-building work.
//
