//  EPGGridScroller.swift
//  Lume
//
//  The guide grid's scrollable machinery: the frozen ruler/channel panes and
//  the single 2D-scrollable programme surface. `EPGGuideView` shapes the data;
//  this file renders and navigates it.
//
//  On tvOS neither the channel column nor the programme cells are focusable.
//  A single focusable surface overlays the guide and interprets the remote
//  itself (`onMoveCommand`), and a *virtual* focus drives the highlight — the
//  channel column doubles as the navigation hub, exactly as it would with
//  real focus. The engine therefore tracks one view for the whole guide:
//  per-press responder walks and focus transactions were the dominant scroll
//  cost in device traces, and programmatic focus handoffs between multiple
//  focusables proved unreliable (the engine silently drops writes made from
//  its own callbacks, while the `@FocusState` binding still reflects them).
//  Every scroll is programmatic, so the frozen panes mirror with one animated
//  write per move instead of per-frame synchronization.
//
