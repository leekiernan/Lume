//  PlaylistDeletion.swift
//  Lume
//
//  Deleting a `Playlist` cascade-removes its `Category` rows (and, in turn, a
//  `Series`' episodes and a `Movie`/`Series`' cast, which cascade from their
//  parents). But `Movie`, `Series` and `LiveStream` are tied to a playlist only
//  by an `id` prefixed with the playlist's UUID — there is no SwiftData
//  relationship to cascade through. Left alone they orphan in the store forever:
//  they bloat storage (Settings then shows far more data than the active
//  playlist holds) and the content indexer keeps resolving titles whose playlist
//  no longer exists.
//
//  This removes that orphaned catalog content alongside the playlist. Run it on
//  the same context the deletion happens on so `@Query`-backed views refresh.
//
