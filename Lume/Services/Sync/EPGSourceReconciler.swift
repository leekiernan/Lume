//  EPGSourceReconciler.swift
//  Lume
//
//  Keeps each playlist's EPG source in step with the playlist. When a playlist
//  is added or edited, its guide URL (Xtream `xmltv.php` or m3u `url-tvg`)
//  becomes a standalone `EPGSource`; when the playlist loses its guide URL or is
//  deleted, that source is removed. Manual sources the user adds in EPG settings
//  carry no `playlistID` and are never touched here.
