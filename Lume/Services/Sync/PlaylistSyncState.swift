//
//  PlaylistSyncState.swift
//  Lume
//
//  What a playlist's sync looks like *right now*, as one value the settings
//  surfaces can render. Derived from state the playlist already carries —
//  `syncStatus`, `lastSyncDate`, `syncEnabled` — plus the global frequency;
//  nothing new is persisted.
//
//  Three places show this (the iOS list row, the tvOS row, and both detail
//  panes), and before this type each decided for itself what was worth
//  mentioning: the list rows said nothing at all, and the detail panes rendered
//  `Last Synced` only when there was a date, so a playlist that had never
//  finished a sync looked exactly like a healthy one. Resolving it once, here,
//  is what keeps those surfaces telling the same story — and keeps the decision
//  unit-testable, like `AutoSync.shouldSync` next door.
//
