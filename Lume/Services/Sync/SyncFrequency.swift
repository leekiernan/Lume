//  Lume
//
//  How often playlists are automatically re-synced in the background.
//
//  The choice is global — it applies to every playlist — and is persisted via
//  `@AppStorage(SyncFrequency.storageKey)`. Whether a *specific* playlist takes
//  part is still gated by its own `syncEnabled` flag. The actual decision of
//  "is this playlist due for a sync right now" lives in `AutoSync.shouldSync`,
//  which the launch / playlist-switch / foreground triggers in `MainTabView`
//  call through.
//
//  Being due is necessary but not sufficient: a due playlist that is not the
//  one on screen waits for the viewer to switch to it. See `AutoSync.shouldSync`
//  for why.
