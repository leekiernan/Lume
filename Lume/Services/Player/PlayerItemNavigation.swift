//
//  PlayerItemNavigation.swift
//  Lume
//
//  Resolves what the in-player previous/next transport buttons play, for both
//  axes the player offers: the episodes of a series and the channels of a live
//  list. Pure, cross-platform data resolution — no view state — so the hosts
//  can resolve once per stream and the result unit-tests without a host.
//
//  The two axes already have resolvers of their own (`NextEpisodeResolver`,
//  `LiveChannelNavigator`); this picks the right one for a stream, applies the
//  rules that belong to the *buttons* rather than to either resolver, and hands
//  back a single answer the overlays can render from.
