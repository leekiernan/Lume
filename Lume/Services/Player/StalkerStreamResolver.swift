//
//  Turns a deferred Stalker `PlayableMedia` (whose URL is a `lumestalker://`
//  placeholder carrying a `create_link` command) into one with a real, freshly
//  resolved stream URL. Stalker URLs are short-lived, so resolution happens at
//  playback time — right before the engine loads — rather than at sync time.
