//  Resolves the OpenSubtitles lookup key for the content currently playing.
//
//  Mirrors `IntroSkipResolver`: the player view owns the SwiftData fetch and
//  hands a plain value down, so the search sheet never touches the catalog
//  models. Live channels resolve to `nil` — OpenSubtitles indexes films and
//  episodes, and a live stream has neither an id nor a stable title to match on.

    /// title match drags in remakes and same-named releases — so both are sent
