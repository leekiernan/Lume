/// Coordinates "casting" — sending playback to an external device — for the
/// player overlay, independent of which playback engine is active.
///
/// AirPlay is routed natively by AVFoundation, so today this service just
/// observes the audio route and surfaces whether playback is currently leaving
/// the device, which the overlay reads for the Cast affordance's accessibility
/// state. The `CastProvider` seam is where a future Google Cast (Chromecast)
/// integration plugs in without the overlay needing to know which casting
/// ecosystem is in use — see issue #103.
///
/// Per-engine AirPlay reality: only the AVPlayer engine can hand full-screen
/// video to an AirPlay receiver (it enables `allowsExternalPlayback`). KSPlayer
/// and VLCKit render into their own layers, so AirPlay would carry only their
/// audio — so when `isAirPlayActive` flips, `FullScreenPlayerView` drives the
/// stream through the AVPlayer engine for the duration of the cast. The route
/// state tracked here is engine-agnostic because AirPlay always reshapes the
/// shared audio route.
///
/// macOS has no `AVAudioSession`, so route observation — and with it the
/// engine handoff — doesn't exist there: `isAirPlayActive` stays `false` and
/// AirPlay is available only on the AVPlayer engine, whose overlay binds the
/// route picker to its player directly (see `AirPlayRouteButton`). tvOS is
/// likewise excluded: the Apple TV is itself the AirPlay destination, so its
/// route always looks "external" and the handoff would wrongly pin every
/// stream to AVPlayer, ignoring the user's engine priority.
