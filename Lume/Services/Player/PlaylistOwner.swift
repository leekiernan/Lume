//  PlaylistOwner.swift
//  Lume
//
//  Resolves the playlist that owns a catalog row from the row's id. Every synced
//  id is written as "<playlist UUID>-<kind>-<provider id>" by `ContentSyncManager`,
//  so the owner is a single indexed lookup rather than a walk of every installed
//  playlist — which is what the player's neighbour resolvers used to do, once per
//  stream, on the main actor.
