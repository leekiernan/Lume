/// Crash-recovery buffer for in-flight watch progress.
///
/// Committing watch progress to SwiftData on a timer forces the main context to
/// merge the change and re-run every `@Query` observing `Movie`/`Episode`/
/// `Series` — most visibly the Home screen's continue-watching rows — on the
/// main thread. That merge is what hitches KSPlayer's render loop every few
/// seconds, even when the `save()` itself runs on a background context.
///
/// So during playback we only stash progress here. The player commits the
/// buffered value to SwiftData only at safe boundaries — close, episode switch,
/// app backgrounding — and whatever is still buffered after a crash or
/// force-quit is reconciled on the next launch.
///
/// Even this lightweight buffer has to be careful: KSPlayer presents frames via
/// a main-run-loop display link *and* keeps decode/render threads busy on the
/// Apple TV's limited cores, so it drops a burst of frames to resync if anything
/// — on or off the main thread — stalls that pipeline for even a few ms. Hence
/// the deliberately minimal write path here: a flat primitive `UserDefaults`
/// layout (no JSON coding, no whole-dict read-modify-write), dispatched onto a
/// serial `.background` queue that yields to the video pipeline, with a paused-
/// playback dedup so a still clock doesn't rewrite anything.
///
/// The on-disk layout is internal — the app isn't published, so there is no
/// legacy format to migrate.
