//  PremiumFeature.swift
//  Lume
//
//  The catalogue of features gated behind Lume Pro on the App Store build.
//  Drives both the paywall's benefits list and the per-feature highlight shown
//  when a gate is hit. Sideloaded builds never see any of this (everything is
//  unlocked), so the copy speaks to the App Store audience.
