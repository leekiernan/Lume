//
//  Builds the personalized "For You" list entirely on-device. Reads the user's
//  favorites, watch history and recommendation votes from the catalog, turns
//  the embeddings the content index already produced into a taste profile (see
//  RecommendationScoring), and ranks unwatched titles against it. Votes live on
//  the catalog models (`recommendationVoteRaw`, mirrored to `UserContentState`),
//  so they sync across devices via iCloud.
//
//  Runs off the main thread on its own background ModelContext, and never holds
//  a managed object across a suspension point — candidates are scored a page at
//  a time and only plain value results survive each page, so a huge catalog
//  costs a bounded amount of memory.
