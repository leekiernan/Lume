//
//  SportsSyncService.swift
//  Lume
//
//  Owns the Sports Hub's refresh and its live-score polling. There is no schedule:
//  sports data is a short-lived cache (`freshness`), re-fetched whenever a sports
//  surface asks for it — the Home rail or hub appearing, the app returning to the
//  foreground, and every tick of the live loop while one of them is on screen.
//
//  Two refresh shapes:
//  - the full refresh (`refreshIfStale`): whole months plus standings (and teams
//    once a week) for every followed league whose snapshot is older than
//    `freshness`;
//  - the live poll (`beginLivePolling`): every 60 s while a sports surface is
//    visible, the full refresh for any league gone stale plus the days of every
//    live or overdue fixture.
//
//  A refresh hits ESPN (not the provider host), so the one-connection account cap
//  that gates `EPGSyncService` does not apply here — the two never compete. The
//  fetching runs on a utility Task; only the finished, `Sendable` snapshots cross
//  back to `SportsStore` on the main actor. A failure leaves the previous snapshot
//  in place and flags `SportsStore.refreshError` rather than blanking the hub; the
//  league stays stale, so the next surface to appear tries again.
