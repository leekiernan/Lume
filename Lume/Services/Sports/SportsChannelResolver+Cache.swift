//
//  SportsChannelResolver+Cache.swift
//  Lume
//
//  Remembers resolved channels per fixture, so a resolve only does the work for
//  fixtures it hasn't seen under the current catalog, guide and viewer.
//
//  Every Sports surface resolves on its own `.task(id:)` — the Home rail, the
//  hub, a league, a game's detail sheet — and each re-runs whenever its fixture
//  set or the guide's sync state flips. At provider scale a resolve reads the
//  guide rows around every kickoff and 57k channels (seconds of SwiftData row
//  materialization), so the same fixtures were resolved again and again.
//
//  A cached answer is reused only while nothing it depends on has moved: the
//  viewer's category restriction and remembered picks, each playlist's last
//  sync, each guide source's last sync, and the number of hidden channels. The
//  entry also expires after `lifetime`, for what that key can't see (a channel
//  renamed between syncs).
