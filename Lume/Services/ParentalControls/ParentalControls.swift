//  ParentalControls.swift
//  Lume
//
//  UI-facing facade for parental controls: the PIN gate. Owns whether a PIN is
//  set and verifies entries; the PIN hash itself lives in the keychain (see
//  `ParentalControlsStore`). The PIN is required to leave a child profile for a
//  non-child one, and to open Content Management — so a child can't lift the
//  restrictions a parent set. Created once in `LumeApp` and injected into the
//  environment.
