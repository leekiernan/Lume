//  ParentalControlsStore.swift
//  Lume
//
//  Keychain-backed storage for the parental-control PIN. The PIN gates leaving a
//  child profile and editing Content Management; it isn't a high-value secret,
//  but it lives in the keychain (encrypted at rest, excluded from plaintext
//  backups) rather than UserDefaults — and only a salted SHA-256 hash is stored,
//  never the PIN itself, so a keychain dump can't reveal a PIN the user might
//  reuse elsewhere.
//
//  Mirrors `TraktTokenStore`: SecItem directly with the safe update-then-add
//  pattern, `kSecUseDataProtectionKeychain` for macOS parity. `WhenUnlocked`
//  accessibility keeps the hash unreadable while the device is locked.
//
//  The keychain is the local store of record — `verify` reads it and nothing
//  else. It is *not* the transport between devices: iCloud Keychain never syncs
//  to tvOS, which is the one platform where an unenforced parental gate matters
//  most. `CloudSyncEngine+Parental` carries the hash between devices over the
//  CloudKit private database instead, using `storedHash` / `store(hash:)` below.
//
//  That reconcile can run while the device is *locked* (the pre-suspension flush
//  fires as the screen locks, and a CloudKit push can wake the process), and a
//  `WhenUnlocked` item is unreadable then. So every accessor below distinguishes
//  "no PIN" from "couldn't look": conflating the two makes the reconciler read a
//  locked keychain as "the parent removed the PIN" and push that deletion to
//  every other device.
//
//  `nonisolated` because that reconcile runs on the `CloudSyncEngine` actor, off
//  the main actor (the project defaults to main-actor isolation). Safe: this type
//  holds no state of its own — every call goes straight to the thread-safe
//  `SecItem` API.
