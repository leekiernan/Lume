//
//  ContentRestriction.swift
//  Lume
//
//  Describes which content is hidden from the current viewer. Two independent
//  sources feed it: categories the user hid in Settings › Content Management
//  (always applied), and categories marked restricted by parental controls
//  (applied only while a child profile is active, so `isActive` is false for a
//  parent). `MainTabView` builds it from both and injects it into the
//  environment; every content surface (browse grids, the cross-category rows,
//  Home, Search and the "For You" engine) reads it so a hidden or restricted
//  category — and any title in it — disappears everywhere alike.
//
//  Everything derived is derived once, in `init`. The union and the digest used
//  to be computed properties, and the readers are hot: `excludingRestricted`
//  asks for the union once per rail, and Home folds the digest into three
//  `.task(id:)` keys — so a single Home body pass hashed all 433 hidden
//  category ids two to three times over, on the main thread, while scrolling.
