//  QuickSwitchResolver.swift
//  Lume
//
//  The single answer to "which playlist / which profile is currently active, and
//  which rows can be switched to" — shared by every switch surface (the iOS /
//  macOS toolbar switcher, the tvOS Settings panes, the tvOS quick-switch
//  overlay) so the decision never gets a fourth divergent copy.
//
//  Deliberately platform-agnostic and view-free: the test targets exclude
//  appletvos, so nothing here may be gated behind `#if os(tvOS)`.
