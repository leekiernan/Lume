//
//  SimklPendingWatched.swift
//  Lume
//
//  Holds the watched episodes a Simkl import could not apply yet.
//
//  Xtream and Stalker only expose episodes through a per-series
//  `get_series_info` call that the series detail screen makes on first open, so
//  a show the user has never opened has a `Series` row and no `Episode` rows.
//  Fetching them all at import time would mean one request per watched show —
//  roughly 250 KB each, so tens of megabytes and minutes of waiting for a
//  hundred shows — to populate episodes nobody is looking at yet.
//
//  Instead the import parks that state here, keyed by the show's TMDB id, and
//  `Series.insertEpisodes` applies it when the detail screen materializes the
//  episodes anyway. Zero extra provider requests; the ticks are simply in place
//  the first time the user opens the series.
//
//  Derived state, not user data: it is rebuilt by the next import, excluded from
//  backup, and an entry is pruned once it has been applied. Kept separate from
//  the Trakt store so the two integrations never overwrite each other's parked
//  progress.
