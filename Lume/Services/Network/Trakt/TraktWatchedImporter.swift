//
//  TraktWatchedImporter.swift
//  Lume
//
//  Applies the watched history fetched from Trakt onto the local catalog: marks
//  matching movies and episodes as watched. The reverse direction of the
//  fire-and-forget scrobbling in `TraktService`, run on demand from the Trakt
//  settings screen.
//
//  Matching is by TMDB id (the only external id the library carries), so titles
//  without a resolved `tmdbId` are skipped. Already-watched items are left
//  untouched so the import is idempotent and the returned counts reflect only
//  what actually changed.
//
//  Series need one extra step. Xtream and Stalker episodes are fetched lazily by
//  the series detail screen, so a show the user has never opened has a `Series`
//  row but no `Episode` rows — nothing for the import to mark. Rather than pull
//  every watched show's episodes here (one ~250 KB provider request each), the
//  import parks that state in `TraktPendingWatchedStore` and
//  `Series.insertEpisodes` applies it when the detail screen fetches the
//  episodes anyway. The series' `lastWatchedDate` is stamped immediately either
//  way, so Home's Recently Watched row is right the moment the import finishes.
//
