//  The store side of an m3u sync, which `PersistenceBenchmarks` never covered:
//  it measures the Xtream write shape, where episodes are fetched lazily per
//  series and so never reach the store in bulk. An m3u file names every episode
//  inline, so an import of the same provider writes ~1.48M `Episode` rows — the
//  kind the sync spends most of its time on, and the one with no benchmark at
//  all until now.
//
//  Split from PersistenceBenchmarks.swift rather than added to it: that file
//  sits at 421 lines against SwiftLint's 600-line limit and its class body at
//  420 against the 400-line type limit, and `swiftlint --strict` runs as an
//  error. The two suites share no state, so a sibling file costs nothing.
//
//  On-disk containers only, like its sibling: an in-memory store bypasses
//  SQLite, which is the cost being measured.
