//  The provider-shaped m3u generator behind
//  `PerfFixtures.writeM3UProviderShape`, kept out of `PerfSupport.swift`
//  because that file is close to SwiftLint's 600-line limit and the hook runs
//  `--strict`.
//
//  Everything here is modelled on one measured provider export: 520 MB,
//  1,719,199 entries — 1,484,110 `/series/` episodes across ~47.4k shows,
//  178,231 `/movie/` rows, 56,858 bare extensionless live URLs, 1,544 distinct
//  group titles. The synthetic mix in `writeM3U` is nothing like that, which is
//  why classification benchmarked against it could not see the regex work.
