//
//  BrowseQueryBenchmarks.swift
//  LumePerformanceTests
//
//  The fetches behind browsing: the Movies/Series collection rails, the Live TV
//  section gates, a category preview row, and search.
//
//  Every one of these was measured on a real 284k-row Xtream catalog and found
//  to be scanning where it should have been seeking. On that store, per
//  interaction, before the browse-latency work:
//
//      cold launch -> Home      1,904 ms of SQL   (10,412 fetches)
//      Movies tab switch          739 ms          ( 7,883 fetches)
//      one "Add to Favorites"   1,158 ms          (23,991 fetches)
//
//  and after it, 774 / 91 / 145 ms. The rest of this target measures the sync
//  and import path; `EPGQueryBenchmarks` measures the two guide loaders. This
//  file is the browse read path, which nothing covered.
//
//  What each benchmark is actually guarding is written on the test. They are
//  mostly one-token regressions — a `sortBy:` added back to a bounded fetch, a
//  `fetchLimit` dropped, `comparator: .lexical` lost to the default — that
//  change no visible row and so survive review and the unit suite. The cheap
//  deterministic half of that guard lives in
//  `LumeTests/Services/BrowseQueryShapeTests.swift`; this half is the cost.
//
//  Scale note: 20k movies / 6k series / 8k channels, the same order as
//  `PersistenceBenchmarks` uses, not the 284k of the measured provider. Big
//  enough that an unindexed scan separates from an index seek by more than the
//  noise floor, small enough to seed in seconds. When chasing a specific
//  regression, raise the counts locally.
